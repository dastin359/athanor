## Run 1 — `ls20-9607627b`, 2026-08-02

**6 of 7 levels cleared in 370 actions. Zero deaths, zero wasted actions, zero
full resets.**

| | |
|---|---|
| model / effort | `claude-opus-5` / `high` |
| budget | 388 actions (`budget_multiple` 0.5 of a 776 baseline) |
| cost | **$13.15**, 116 turns, 41.6 min |
| rule book | 42 mechanics, 13 refutations |
| exit | clean, voluntary — the cap was never hit |

### Per level

Actions are trace-derived: **every** action spent while on that level, including
abandoned attempts.

| level | actions | baseline | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 17 | 22 | 77% |
| 1 | 59 | 123 | 48% |
| 2 | 67 | 73 | 92% |
| 3 | 49 | 84 | 58% |
| 4 | 83 | 96 | 86% |
| 5 | 94 | 192 | 49% |
| 6 | 1 | 186 | not attempted |
| **0–5** | **369** | **590** | **63%** |

The baseline is a playthrough by someone who already knows the rules. This
solver was discovering them and still finished six levels at 63% of it.

### It stopped on purpose, not on the cap

18 actions remained. The solver's own account:

> *"Level 6 was reached with 18 actions left against a baseline of 186, so it
> wasn't attemptable."*

That is the §2.6 control law working as designed: the published per-level
baseline told it the remainder could not finish the level, so it declined to
spend it. A solver without that number has no way to distinguish "this level is
long" from "I have misunderstood it", and would have burned the remainder.

**The budget was the only binding constraint.** At its demonstrated 63% pace the
full seven levels cost roughly 486 actions against a 776 baseline — comfortably
inside a `1.0x` budget. The halved cap was chosen deliberately to bound a first
run; it is what stood between this and a win, not the solver.

### What it worked out about the game

Reverse-engineered from nothing but frames, with no external information:

- A 12×13 logical board rendered at 5 px per cell.
- Win condition: step into a framed panel with the HUD's **current** 3×3 pattern
  matching the panel's **target** pattern, in both shape *and* colour.
- Four item transforms: a white plus rotates the icon 90° clockwise; a second
  white item applies an arbitrary but deterministic map on shapes; a four-colour
  pinwheel advances colour one step (blue→green→red→orange→blue); yellow rings
  refuel.
- A colour-1 bar on a **wall** edge marks the adjacent floor cell as a launcher —
  entering it slides the cursor away from that wall until blocked, in a single
  action, stopping one cell short of a goal panel.
- Items **patrol**. Walking onto an item's starting cell twice did nothing
  because the item had moved; interception means moving into the cell it is
  moving *into*.

### A counting discrepancy worth keeping

The solver's own summary reported level 0 as 18 actions and level 4 as 62; the
trace says 17 and 83. Level 4 is the real gap.

The scorecard records `resets: [2]` against zero deaths, so the solver twice
reset a level deliberately to re-approach it. Its table counts the actions of the
**winning route**; the trace counts **everything spent on that level**. Both are
meaningful, and they answer different questions — but only the trace number is
the one a budget is spent in, which is why `collect_outcome` reads the ledger and
never the solver's account.

### Harness behaviour

Everything the harness is for either fired correctly or was never needed:

- The level gate held at all six boundaries and was acknowledged each time.
- Zero wasted actions — the solver never acted while dead.
- Zero full resets — the RESET-after-advance trap never triggered.
- Two deliberate level resets, which the doctrine now describes as a legitimate
  retry rather than only a death recovery.
- Ledger and server agree exactly on per-level action counts.

## Probe — is the `ls20` bar lethal? 2026-08-02

Scripted, no model involved: open a scorecard, wander for 120 actions, watch
row 61.

**It is not lethal.** The bar holds 42 yellow cells, drains exactly one per
action, reads 0 at actions 42 and 85, and **refills to 42 automatically** — with
zero cells changing outside the bar rows at the refill, so nothing was collected
to cause it. A clean 43-action cycle, twice, no `GAME_OVER` in 120 actions of
aimless movement.

This corrects the doctrine, which said a depleting per-level resource means
*"exhausting it kills you"*. That came from an SDK prompt hint
(`_llm.py:580`, "you GAME_OVER if you run out") which belongs to some other
game, generalised further than the evidence supported. On `ls20` the display is
a cycle, and a solver told it was lethal would rush, skip experiments and waste
the exploration budget the rest of the doctrine tells it to spend.

It also explains the zero deaths across run 1's 370 actions: on this game there
was nothing to die of by wandering.

The doctrine now says find the display, then find out what it does — letting it
run out once, early in a level, is a cheap experiment whose answer changes how
the whole game is played.

Still open: whether a post-`GAME_OVER` RESET opens a new scorecard play row.
Neither run has died, and on `ls20` dying by exhaustion appears impossible, so
this needs a different game.

## Probe — what a death actually costs, 2026-08-02

Scripted, no model. Random legal actions on four games until something died.

| game | tag | actions | outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cd82-fb555c5d` | keyboard_click | 71 | no death |
| `ft09-0d8bbf25` | — | 71 | no death |
| `r11l-495a7899` | click | 38 | **GAME_OVER**, on level 1 |
| `sb26-7fbdac44` | keyboard_click | 71 | no death |

`r11l` answers the last open question in the design note. Across the death and
the RESET that followed: `total_plays` stayed **1**, `levels_completed` stayed
**[1]**, and `full_reset` was **not set**.

- **A post-`GAME_OVER` RESET does not open a new play row.** A play belongs to a
  scorecard, not to a life, so `Card.scores` and `Card.actions` are per-play and
  dying inside one adds no entry.
- **It is a level reset** — §2.3 replicated on a second game and a different tag.
- **The completed level survived the death.** This is the direct confirmation of
  the doctrine's central claim: dying costs no progress, so it is a legitimate
  experiment.

Deaths are reachable on some games and evidently not on others. `ls20` cycles
its bar rather than killing; three of four probed games survived 71 random
actions. So "avoid GAME_OVER" is not merely wrong as a terminal goal — on
several games it is not even an available failure mode by wandering.

Residual, one sample only: the scorecard's `states` still read `['GAME_OVER']`
after the RESET. Do not read `states` as the live state.

## Run 2 — `ls20-9607627b` **WON**, 2026-08-02

**All 7 levels cleared in 489 actions against a 776 baseline — 63%. Zero
deaths, zero wasted actions, zero full resets.**

| level | actions | baseline | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 17 | 22 | 77% |
| 1 | 59 | 123 | 48% |
| 2 | 67 | 73 | 92% |
| 3 | 49 | 84 | 58% |
| 4 | 83 | 96 | 86% |
| 5 | 94 | 192 | 49% |
| **6** | **120** | **186** | **65%** |
| **total** | **489** | **776** | **63%** |

66 mechanics and 16 refutations recorded. Model `claude-opus-5`, effort `high`.

### The rate was stable, not lucky

Run 1 reached 63% of baseline over levels 0-5 and stopped without attempting
level 6. Level 6 — the longest, and the one no run had touched — came in at 65%.
The prediction made when run 1 stopped was "roughly 486 actions for the full
game at the demonstrated pace". It took **489**.

### An accidental reproducibility check

The resume was supposed to continue from level 6 and instead replayed the game
from level 0 (see the bug below). That accident is the most useful control this
project has produced: **levels 0-5 took 369 actions in run 1 and 369 in the
replay**, in independent sessions three hours apart. Identical, action for
action.

### The resume bug

`result.json` reports `actions_used: 860` because the ledger spans both
playthroughs. The honest figure for a complete game is **489**; the other 371
were the resume re-walking ground already covered.

The resume preserved the *ledger* but not the *game*: trace indices continued
correctly from 370 and the trace was not wiped, yet the server replayed from
level 0 on a fresh scorecard. Resumption tests correct in isolation — building a
client against the archived run-1 state restores the right card, level and
action count with the trace intact — so the fault is somewhere in the live
sequence and has not been reproduced.

It was not diagnosable after the fact because `run_game` opened `stream.jsonl`
with `"w"`, so starting the resume truncated the record of the handoff. Both are
now fixed: a previous stream is renamed aside, and `run_game` writes
`resume_state.json` before the solver starts, recording what the client
restored. The next occurrence will be readable from one file.

## Batch 1 — four games across every tag type, 2026-08-02

| game | tag | levels | actions | baseline | rate | deaths |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ls20-9607627b` | keyboard | **7/7 WON** | 489 | 776 | 63% | 0 |
| `ft09-0d8bbf25` | untagged | **6/6 WON** | 75 | 208 | **36%** | 0 |
| `r11l-495a7899` | click | **6/6 WON** | 82 | 233 | **35%** | 0 |
| `cd82-fb555c5d` | keyboard_click | **0/6** | 337 | 171 | — | 1 |

Three wins from four, clustered at 35-63% of a baseline set by someone who
already knew the rules. One total failure that never left level 0, burning 6.1x
that level's 55-action baseline.

**The variance between games dwarfs everything else measured on this project.**
A single-game result — which is all `ls20` was — is correspondingly weak
evidence, and the 63% figure quoted from it now looks like the *worst* of the
three wins rather than a representative number.

### What the failure looks like from the trace

| game | action types used | actions that changed nothing |
|---|---|---|
| `cd82` | **7** | **20%** (67 of 336) |
| `ls20` | 5 | 0% |
| `ft09` | **1** | 0% |
| `r11l` | **1** | 0% |

**Every win wasted zero actions. The failure wasted one in five**, and clicks
were the worst of it — 46 of 157 `ACTION6`s left the board untouched.

**Hypothesis, n=1 on the key cell: a wide action space is what breaks it.**
`cd82` is the only game here where keyboard *and* click are both available, and
the solver spread effort across all seven types rather than establishing which
modality mattered. The two fastest wins used exactly **one** action type each.

This is a testable prediction rather than a conclusion, and it is an
uncomfortable one: **13 of the 25 public games are `keyboard_click`**, so if it
holds, the harness is systematically weak on more than half the set. The next
batch should be drawn from `keyboard_click` games specifically, to confirm or
kill it.

### What it argues the harness should do

The doctrine already says to trust `available_actions` over the tags. That is
necessary and evidently not sufficient: **available is not the same as
effective**. Nothing establishes which of the available actions actually do
anything, and a solver facing seven of them has no cheap way to find out.

Roughly seven actions spent probing each available action once, against a
possible saving of hundreds, is the trade. This is the same shape as every other
finding here — doctrine that stays prose gets ignored, and the version that
survives is a function.

### The click space is easier, not harder

Recorded because it contradicts a prediction stated twice while building this.
`ACTION6` covers a 64x64 coordinate space against four directions for keyboard,
so clicks looked like the harder search. `r11l` is the second-most efficient run
in the set and never probed a single unavailable action.

The likely reason is the one §9.7 already identified: a click acts *directly* on
a target the solver has located in the frame, while a keyboard game must **route**
to it. Verification is cheap here and planning is expensive, so the modality that
skips the routing wins.

`r11l` also took **zero deaths on the one game where a scripted random policy
died in 38 actions** — the solver avoided entirely a failure mode that random
play walks straight into.

"""Token-efficient rendering of gate output.

The gate is the only channel the harness has for speaking to the solver agent:
Claude Code owns the agent loop, so Athanor's orchestrator-injected reflection
prompts have to arrive as *tool output* instead. Everything the flagship
orchestrator would have pushed into the conversation — the failure diff, the
reflection schema, the generalization audit, the best-effort switch — is emitted
here, appended to the result of ``python gate.py …``.

Formatting follows the same rule the solver is held to: spend tokens on
information the model cannot cheaply recompute, and nothing else.

NEXT — reflect before your next submission. Append a dated entry to NOTES.md covering:

1. Diff analysis — for each failed example, what differs between prediction and
   ground truth, and where the logic went wrong.
2. Failure root cause — wrong assumption, coding bug, or unhandled edge case?
   "I assumed X, but actually Y" beats "my code was wrong".
3. Verified rules — invariants that hold regardless of your current hypothesis.
   Establish each one by running arc.verify() in an exploration script; do not
   assert them from memory.
4. Dead ends — hypotheses this attempt rules out, so you do not revisit them.
5. Next experiment — the specific check you will run, and what each outcome
   would tell you.

Then go back to exploration. Run the experiment before writing the next
hypothesis: a submission that is not preceded by a new verified fact is a guess.
"""

GENERALIZATION_AUDIT_DIRECTIVE = """\
NEXT — training is solved, generalization is not. Nothing above tells you the
rule is right; it tells you the rule is consistent with the examples you were
allowed to see.

Write solution/audit.md with exactly these sections:

  CONFIDENCE: <1-5>
  DECISION: ACCEPT | RETRY
  REASONS:
  <your analysis>

Anchor the confidence number, because an unanchored one is worthless. Across
this experiment every audit has claimed 4 or 5 and none has ever said RETRY —
including runs that were wrong, one of which claimed 5. So:

  5  every situation the test input requires is witnessed in a training pair,
     and you have executed a check saying so.
  4  as above, except one such situation is unwitnessed and you have hedged it
     with your second candidate.
  3  a situation the test needs is unwitnessed and you have NOT hedged it, or
     you hedged a different axis than the one you are unsure about.
  2  the rule fits training and you cannot say why it should generalise.
  1  you are submitting because the budget is running out.

A 3 or below is a reason to spend another iteration, not a reason to write a
longer justification.

Cover, in REASONS:
- Assumption audit. Does the code lean on any training-only coincidence — exact
  grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific counts, colours with no semantic
  role? For every constant in solve.py, say why it is role-based rather than
  incidental.
- Prediction plausibility. Do the test predictions above follow from the same
  rule that explains all training pairs? Name any artefact that smells like
  overfitting: stray pixels, missing structure, wrong recolour, bad alignment.
- Verification. Back the audit with executed checks where you can — for
  instance, confirm the predicted test outputs satisfy the invariants you
  verified on the training outputs.
- Candidate budget. ARC-AGI-2 scores two predictions per test example, so a
  single candidate forfeits one for free. If you considered an alternative
  reading and ruled it out, examine *how*. Killing it with a training pair it
  fails is a proof. Killing it by extending a regularity that merely holds
  across the training outputs to the test input is an inductive leap wearing a
  proof's clothes — the invariant is real, but nothing established that it
  survives out of sample. When an alternative reproduces every training pair and
  died only to a leap like that, emit it as the second candidate. That is
  exactly the case the second attempt exists for, and it costs you nothing.

Then run: python gate.py accept
DECISION: RETRY refuses acceptance and returns you to the loop with an iteration
spent — which is the correct outcome when the audit finds a real hole.
"""

BEST_EFFORT_DIRECTIVE = """\
STRATEGY SHIFT — the training-accuracy requirement is lifted.

Most of your iteration budget is gone without a train-perfect rule. That happens
when the rule is unusually subtle, or when the training pairs are not quite
self-consistent under any simple rule.

`gate.py accept` will now accept your best submission regardless of training
score. Stop optimising for training coverage and optimise for the test outputs
being right: pick the hypothesis with the strongest evidence behind it, and use
your second candidate on the genuine alternative reading rather than on a
throwaway variant.

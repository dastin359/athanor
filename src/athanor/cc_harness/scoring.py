"""Scoring and integrity checks for CC-harness runs.

Scoring follows ARC-AGI-2: each test example is scored independently and counts
as solved when **any** submitted candidate matches its ground-truth output
exactly; the task score is the fraction of test examples solved.

Ground truth is held here, never in the workspace — which makes the integrity
check meaningful: if the solver reached the benchmark data anyway, the run is
contaminated and the score is worthless.

"""System-prompt composition for the CC harness.

The ARC-specific parts of the solver prompt — who the agent is, and what it
knows about the benchmark's priors and primitives — are **shared verbatim with
the flagship solver**. That is not just deduplication: comparing the two
harnesses is only meaningful if the domain knowledge is held constant, so any
measured difference is attributable to the harness rather than to the priors.

Sections 3 onward (goal, methodology, tools, loop) are harness-specific and come
from ``assets/CC_SOLVER_DOCTRINE.md``.

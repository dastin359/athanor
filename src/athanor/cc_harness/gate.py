"""The verification gate — the harness's only enforcement point.

Claude Code owns the agent loop in this variant, so everything Athanor's
orchestrator enforced by construction has to be enforced here instead:

============================  ==================================================
Athanor orchestrator          CC harness gate
============================  ==================================================
tool ordering forces          ``submit`` refuses code that changed without a
``submit_transform_            correspondingly updated hypothesis
hypothesis`` first
``execute_python_solution``   ``submit`` consumes one budgeted iteration and
counts as one iteration       appends an immutable record under ``.athanor/``
reflection prompt injected    the failure report ends with the reflection
into the conversation         directive (see :mod:`.reporting`)
test-generalization           ``accept`` requires ``solution/audit.md`` with an
self-audit turn               explicit CONFIDENCE / DECISION
best-effort prompt near       the gate lifts the train-100% requirement over the
budget exhaustion             trailing iterations
============================  ==================================================

Exploration is untouched by all of this: running ``python explore/whatever.py``
costs nothing and is the intended way to do almost all of the work.

Usage (from inside a run workspace)::

    python gate.py status
    python gate.py submit
    python gate.py accept

#: Built-in tools the solver may use. Empty means **do not pass ``--tools``** —
#: the solver gets Claude Code's full default surface, minus the deny list.
#:
#: This is the point of the variant: "Claude Code as harness" is only an honest
#: test if the agent gets Claude Code, not a hand-picked six-tool subset. The
#: earlier allowlist (Bash/Read/Write/Edit/Glob/Grep/TodoWrite) withheld
#: sub-agents, workflows, skills and background tasks — capability the product

#: Tools **pre-approved** so a headless run never stalls on a permission prompt.

#: ``--allowedTools`` does two jobs at once: it restricts the surface *and* it
#: grants permission. Dropping it to open the surface also removed the grant —
#: `acceptEdits` auto-approves file writes but not arbitrary Bash, so every
#: `python explore/foo.py` was denied and two runs burned ~$2 each producing
#: nothing. The surface is opened by omitting ``--tools``; permission is granted
#: here, explicitly.

#: 1. **Research.** ARC requires no external knowledge and a network answer
#:    would contaminate the benchmark outright.
#: 2. **Reaching the network by another door.** Registry, plugin and connector
#:    lookups are not "research", but they are outbound calls, and a benchmark
#:    that claims no network access has to mean it.
#: 3. **Escaping the run.** Publishing, notifying the user, or scheduling work

    Every task runs in its own workspace, so cwd differs per task — and cwd sits
    in Claude Code's default system prompt. That changes the cached prefix on
    every task and defeats cross-task prompt-cache reuse entirely: measured
    directly, a second workspace wrote byte-identical cache to the first rather
    than reading it.

    Keep the size honest. What this recovers is the system-prompt prefix across
    tasks, a few thousand tokens; the bulk of a run's cache traffic is
    within-task, as each turn writes the growing conversation. The flagship's
    own figure puts batch amortisation at $5.80 over 119 tasks — about $0.05 a
    task. This is a correctness fix to a mechanism that was fully broken, not a
    material cost lever.

    The flag moves cwd, env info, memory paths and git status into the first
    user message instead. It applies only alongside the default system prompt,
    which is what this harness uses (`--append-system-prompt`, not
    `--system-prompt`).

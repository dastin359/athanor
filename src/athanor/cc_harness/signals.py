"""Mechanical generalization signals — a partial stand-in for the reviewer.

This variant drops Athanor's independent artifact-only reflector, and
``docs/design.md`` is explicit that reviewing artifacts is the only mechanism
among top ARC systems that can reject a solution passing training 100% on
generalization grounds. That leaves a hole exactly where the hard tasks live: a
rule that reproduces every training pair and is still wrong.

A model-based reviewer is out of scope here. What is in scope is the cheap half
of what a reviewer does — noticing that a test prediction breaks a regularity
every training output obeys. That needs no model, no second context, and no
tokens beyond the finding itself.

Design rule: **only report a signal when every training output agrees and the
prediction disagrees.** A false positive here is expensive — it spends the
solver's attention and teaches it to discount the channel — so each check
abstains unless the training set is unanimous.
